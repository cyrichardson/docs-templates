Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~


In a network, a node (or server) is a connection point - either a redistribution point or an 
end point for data transmissions. In general, a node has programmed or engineered capability 
to recognize and process or forward transmissions to other nodes. A node is a member of a cluster.

Use the Nodes API operations to retrieve the list of nodes for a specified cluster.

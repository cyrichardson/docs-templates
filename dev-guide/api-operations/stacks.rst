Stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stacks are high-level building blocks of software that compose a Big Data architecture. 
Stacks are comprised of services, which in turn are comprised of components. 
A stack is specific to a distribution due to the differences in services that are 
supported across distributions.

Use the Stacks API operations to create a stack, to list all stacks, and to get information 
about or delete a specific stack by stack ID.

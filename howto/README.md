This *will be* a place to collect templates for short, single-focus articles such as those that *will be* at http://support.rackspace.com/howto, for readers who would otherwise be guided by Rackspace Support:

- step-by-step procedure
- follow-along tutorial 
- situational troubleshooting
- more coming
 
These templates are for articles to be published as standalone pieces. 
Simple articles are coded in Markdown.

Other directories here, such as /dev-guide/ and /user-guide/, provide templates for content that requires a more complex structure. 
Complex documents are coded in RST.

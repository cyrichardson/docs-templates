Templates to assist in creating release notes
=============================================

These are starting points for release notees that will be
constructed and published elsewhere:

* maintain the doc source in a GitHub repository
* publish the release notes at developer.rackspace.com
  or other appropriate location

Choosing a template
-------------------
Release notes can be included in an API Developer Guide;
if this is what you intend,
follow the template
in [/dev-guide/release-notes/](../dev-guide/release-notes/) in this repo.

Release notes can be published as a standalone document;
if this is what you intend,
follow the template here.

Finding examples
----------------
Examining how other release notes are constructed
is an excellent way to learn how to construct your own.

Release notes *within a developer guide*:
* doc source at https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-cloud-databases/tree/master/apidocs/dev-guide/release-notes
* published at https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-databases/v1/developer-guide/#document-release-notes
* if you have other great examples, add them

Release notes *as a standalone document*:
* doc source at https://github.com/getcarina/getcarina.com/blob/master/_reference/2015-10-17-release-notes.md
* published at https://getcarina.com/docs/reference/release-notes/ 
* if you have other great examples, add them

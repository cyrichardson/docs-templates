Templates to assist in creating release notes
=============================================

These are starting points for release notees that will be
constructed and published elsewhere:

* maintain the doc source in a GitHub repository
* publish the release notes at developer.rackspace.com
  or other appropriate location

Choosing a template
-------------------
Release notes can be included in an API Developer Guide;
if this is what you intend,
follow the template in /dev-guide/release-notes/ in this repo.

Release notes can be published as a standalone document;
if this is what you intend,
follow the template here.

Finding examples
----------------
Examining how other release notes are constructed
is an excellent way to learn how to construct your own.

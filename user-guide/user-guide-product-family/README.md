Userguide template for *product family*
=======================================
This directory contains a model of all the parts required
to construct one type of user guide.

Examples
--------
For example, the Cloud Core Infrastructure Services guide discusses
several products as complementary members of a set;
one purpose of the guide is to help readers
choose from within the set the most appropriate product or products
for their use case.

This example is published at
https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/.

Doc source for this example is maintained at
https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-core-infra-user-guide.

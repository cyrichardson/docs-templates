If you develop or distribute applications for your customers,
or if you wish to heavily automate operation of your
XXexampleXX configuration,
you might need to interact with cloud services
through one of the many available software development kits
or by

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Software Development Kits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rackspace supports several Software Development Kits (SDKs)
to facilitate coding in popular programming languages.
SDKs demonstrate basic operations in multiple languages;
you may find useful examples that you can adapt to your own purpose,
even if an SDK does not include an example of exactly what you plan to do.

You can learn about SDKs at
:rax-dev-quickstart:`SDK Quick Starts <cloud-servers/getting-started/>`.

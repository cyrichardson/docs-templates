GUI: Rackspace Cloud Control Panel
----------------------------------
The Rackspace :mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel <>` is
the easiest way to start provisioning cloud resources.

The Cloud Control Panel provides a simple, unified web-based interface
that works in all major browsers. After you sign up for a Cloud account
at :rax:`www.rackspace.com <>`, visit the Cloud Control panel
to get an overview of the available products and services,
create your first servers and resources, and view information about
your Rackspace account.

You can also use the Cloud Control Panel to complete some important
first tasks:

* :kc-article:`Obtain your API key <view-and-reset-your-api-key>`
  for use with
  :ref:`CLIs <cli>` and
  :ref:`APIs <api>`.

* :kc-article:`Create additional account users <managing-role-based-access-control-rbac>`
  and give them
  :kc-article:`permissions <permissions-matrix-for-role-based-access-control-rbac>`
  if needed

  .. note::
     Users who do not have permission to use a feature
     do not see that feature in the Cloud Control Panel.
     Cloud Control Panel screenshots in
     `technical documentation <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/>`__
     might show features that are not
     available to some users.

* View and change resource limits

  If you click the **Request Limit Increase** link, the system
  generates a support ticket with the details of your current limits.
  To make a change, describe what you want and
  submit the ticket for processing. Update the ticket to
  describe the change you want; then click **Submit Ticket**.

The Cloud Control Panel might be the only interface that you need to use,
especially if you don't need to heavily automate the management of your
cloud resources.

.. note::
   Occasionally,
   high-priority messages are displayed in a banner
   at the top of the Cloud Control Panel window.
   If you see such a message,
   follow its instructions as soon as you can.

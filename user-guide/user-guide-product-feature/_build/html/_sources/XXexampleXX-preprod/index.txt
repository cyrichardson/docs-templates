==========================
Preparing for productivity
==========================
Before you begin performing useful work with XXexampleXX,
your first activities should ensure that it is
secure, running necessary software, and regularly backed up. These are
good practices with or without XXexampleXX.

Because you probably chose to use
XXexampleXX to deal with a rapidly changing workload, it's important for
you to begin two additional good practices now to prepare you to
recognize and respond to usage peaks:

* Establish a monitoring protocol to alert you to unusual events
* Establish scaling policies to enable your configuration to grow as needed

.. NOTE::
   Securing your own server and establishing your own backups
   provides a layer of protection that you can control,
   in addition to the protection provided by Rackspace's reliable
   infrastructure. You can read about
   our infrastructure at

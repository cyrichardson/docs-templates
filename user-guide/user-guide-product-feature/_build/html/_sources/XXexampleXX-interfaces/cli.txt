CLI: Command-line interfaces and tools
--------------------------------------
If you want to manage your cloud configuration
by typing commands or executing shell scripts,
you can use command-line interfaces (CLIs)
provided by OpenStack and,
in some cases, supported by Rackspace.

You can also use Rackspace's dedicated CLI
client, ``rack``,
documented at
:rax-dev-docs:`Rackspace Command Line Interface <rack-cli>`.

Userguide template for *product plus prereqs*
=============================================
..
  For example, the Rackspace Auto Scale DIY guide places Auto Scale at the center
  and builds up to it from its prerequisites;
  one purpose of the guide is to help readers understand
  the context of preparatory steps required to take full advantage of Auto Scale.

  This example is published at *nowhere yet*.
  Doc source for this example is maintained at
  https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-auto-scale-user-guide.

  BACK SOON WITH AN ACTUAL TEMPLATE HERE.

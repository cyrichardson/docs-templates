Userguide templates for *fragmentary contributions*
===================================================
This directory contains models of small pieces of content to be placed within
a larger guide. Use these models to help shape content contributed as
GitHub issues or pull requests.

Choosing a template
-------------------
Each file in this directory describes the shape of a content fragment that is
commonly used within userguides.
Nothing in this directory is meant to be buildable or publishable as a standalone
document.

- Use *troubleshooting.md* as the basis of advice about recognizing, correcting,
  and preventing problems.

  Contributions shaped like this are published in pages similar to
  https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-ops/troubleshoot/.

- Use *usecase.md* as the basis of instructions for setting up a configuration
  for a specific purpose.

  Contributions shaped like this are published in pages similar to
  https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-config/storage/cloud-files-product-concepts/ideal-uses/
  (if each item in the list of "ideal uses" were fully explicated).

- Use *action.md* as the basis of an explanation of one action that can be
  performed by one service.

  Contributions shaped like this are published in pages similar to
  https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-config/compute/cloud-servers-product-actions/#resize.

Contributing fragmentary content
--------------------------------
In the GitHub repo for the userguide you want to contribute to,
create an issue suggesting the improvement you want to make.
If you are actively working on that improvement, assign the issue to yourself.

Choose the template that most resembles the type of fragment you want to contribute.
Make a local copy and customize it.

If you can find the place within
the userguide's repo to place your new content
and you know how to make a GitHub pull request,
place your new content on the appropriate page and submit a pull request
asking for editing and publication.

Otherwise,
paste your customized content into the issue you created.

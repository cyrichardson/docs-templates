Userguide template for *product plus prereqs*
=============================================
This directory contains a model of all the parts required
to construct one type of user guide.

Examples
--------
For example, the Rackspace Auto Scale DIY guide places Auto Scale at the center
and builds up to it from its prerequisites;
one purpose of the guide is to help readers understand
the context of preparatory steps required to take full advantage of Auto Scale.

This example is published at *nowhere yet*.

Doc source for this example is maintained at
https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-auto-scale-user-guide.

Alternatives
------------
If this template is not a good match for the user guide you intend to create,
examine the other templates in /docs-templates/user-guide.
